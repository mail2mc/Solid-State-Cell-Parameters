### Comments for the estimated parameters
*****************************************************************
The parameters for this model were estimated for the temperature range [298.15K, 328.15K] and for the voltage range [3.0V, 4.2V]. 

The experimental procedures can be found in this manuscript and in our previous work:

**Open-circuit voltage (OCV):**
The measurement of OCV as a function of stoichiometry requires overcharging the cell beyond its electrochemical stability limit to estimate 
the minimum lithium content of the cell. This procedure causes a hysteresis effect at the C-rate of C/40. Due to limited available cells 
and the spread in the measured initial impedance of tested cells, the OCV data measured under the same operating condition in our previous 
work was used in this manuscript.

By using the previously measured impedance as the reference point, screening was performed in this work to choose the cell that resembles the impedance
characteristics: two convoluted semi-circles with one diffusion tail. The remaining experiments, which do not require overcharging or 
over-discharging procedures, were performed on the screened cell.
